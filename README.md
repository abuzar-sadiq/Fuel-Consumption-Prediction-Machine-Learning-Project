# Fuel-Consumption-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
Hypothesis based EDA:

Which brand (or make) has more share of vehicles with less than 8.0 fuel consumption?

Plot the correlation scatter plot for the engine size and fuel consumption.

Create a pairplot with all the numerical variables and note down the observations/insights

Create a new column named “Transmission type” from the TRANSMISSION column by separating out the gears from the alphabets. (Hint: use regex)

Build Linear regression model with only the numerical features using Statsmodels library. Note down the R2, Adjusted R2. 

One-hot encode categorical variables and Build Linear regression model using Statsmodels library. Note down the R2, Adjusted R2. Compare it with the previous model.
